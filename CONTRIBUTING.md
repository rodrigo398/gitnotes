## Merge Request Process

1.  Once you have found or opened an issue you would like to work on, either
    assign yourself or request to be assigned to this issues. This will let
    others know you are working on it.

2.  After cloning the repository, please make sure you are working from the
    latest version. Create your own branch, then begin working on your
    contribution. We encourage you to follow the naming convention
    `your-username/my-awesome-feature` when creating branches.

3.  To make sure your changes don't break run `npm test` to run the unit tests.

4.  We request that commit messages should start with a tag indicating what the
    purpose of the commit is. `fix:`, `doc:`, `chore:`, `feat:`, for example,
    this makes everything a bit clearer in the git history. You can optionally
    break down these into areas like `feat(sidebar):`.

5.  When you are ready to get feedback on your branch, create a merge request
    on Gitlab.

    > If you still have planned work to do on the branch add `WIP:` to the
    > start of the merge request title to block it from being merged. Remove
    > this tag when you are ready for your work to be looked at in detail or
    > are otherwise ready for your work to be merged.

6.  Finally, once your code has been reviewed and approved, you can then merge
    your branch into `master`!
