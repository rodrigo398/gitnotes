# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via
the issue board, or slack channel. If you have a feature request, bug to report or idea, feel
free to open an issue on the [Gitlab issue board](https://gitlab.com/skillcamp/gitnotes/issues).
Our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/gitnotes/shared_invite/enQtMzc2MzMyNDg2MjkzLTU5OTg5NGUxYTQ3NWQxNzY2ZTdmMTc0M2MwOWY2ODFhMjM3M2RmNzUxM2I2ZWIyZjk4ODkzMDU4MjcyNTRjODI)
is great for asking questions, collaborating on ideas and discussing issues.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Merge Request Process

1.  Once you have found or opened an issue you would like to work on, either assign yourself,
    or request to be assigned to this issues. This will let other know you are working on it.

2.  After cloning the repository, please make sure you are working from the latest version. Create your own branch, then
    begin working on your contribution. We encourage you to follow the naming convention `your-username/my-awesome-feature` when
    creating branches.

3.  We request that commit messages should start with a tag indicating what the purpose of the commit is.
    `fix:`, `doc:`, `chore:`, `feature:`, for example. This makes everything a bit clearer in the git history.

4.  When you are ready to get feedback on your branch, create a merge request on Gitlab.
    `WIP:` (work in progress) should be added to the start of your initial merge request title.
    This will prevent the branch from accidentally being merged, until the code has been discussed
    and reviewed.

5.  Finally, once your code has been approved, remove the `WIP:` tag. You can then merge your branch  
    into `master`.
